# fall_2025_exercises_and_notes
I have recently become interested in improving my programming skills, developing a better understanding of computer science. In particular I am interested in learning about cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs, and formal verification, as well as machine learning and statistics. The purpose of this repository is to keep track of my notes, exercises, and small projects that I complete along the way. The purpose of this repository is to hold myself accountable and create some artifact from my learning process. In particular the reader should understand that code contained here may be broken or incomplete, and notes may contain typos or other issues.
